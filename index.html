			<h3 style="text-align: left;">So, you wanna know how to access Veron1CA?</h3>
			<p style="text-align: left;">To control Veron1CA, you need three special roles, BotPilot, BotMod and BotAdmin. BotPilot is for standard operations like sending DMs, playing music, greeting members etc. On the other hand, BotMod and BotAdmin - these two are used to access server management and moderation tools/commands. When you have atleast one of these three roles assigned to you, you can start by typing //help in chat. The default command prefix for Veron1CA is // but as it's open source, you can change it anytime!</p>
